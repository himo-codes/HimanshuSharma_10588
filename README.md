📌 PROJECT TITLE
Digital Root Calculator using C

📖  Project Details (Description)

The Digital Root Calculator is a C-based program that calculates the digital root of a given number.
The digital root is obtained by repeatedly summing the digits of a number until a single-digit value is produced.
This project is implemented using loops and arithmetic operations without using any built-in shortcuts, making it efficient and easy to understand for beginners.

🎯  Why This Project Was Created (Purpose)

This project was created to:
Understand loops (while loop) in C
Learn digit extraction using modulo (%) and division (/)
Practice basic algorithm design
Strengthen problem-solving skills using iteration instead of recursion
Apply theoretical concepts of number systems into a practical program
It is a beginner-friendly project suitable for C programming labs and exams.

🛠️ Utility / Applications of Digital Root

The Digital Root concept is useful in many real-world scenarios:
Mathematics
Used to check divisibility (especially by 9)
Helps in number validation
Computer Science
Used in checksum algorithms
Useful in hashing and data validation
Numerology
Digital root is used to calculate life path numbers
Education
Helps students understand loops, conditions, and digit manipulation

⚙️ Algorithm Used

Read an integer from the user
While the number has more than one digit:
Initialize sum = 0
Extract digits using % 10
Add digits to sum
Update number with sum
Repeat until a single digit is obtained
Display the final digital root

🚀  Future Scope of the Project

This project can be extended in the future by:
Supporting very large numbers (strings)
Adding graphical user interface (GUI)
Implementing recursive approach
Adding error handling for invalid input
Converting it into a web-based calculator
Optimizing using mathematical digital root formula

📘 What I Learned While Developing This Project

While developing the Digital Root Calculator using C, I learned the following important concepts and skills:

🔹 1. Understanding Loops in C
I learned how to use while loops effectively to perform repeated operations until a specific condition is satisfied.

🔹 2. Digit Extraction Technique
I learned how to extract digits from a number using:
Modulo operator (%) to get the last digit
Division operator (/) to remove the last digit
This technique is very useful in many number-based problems.

🔹 3. Algorithm Design & Logical Thinking
I understood how to:
Break a problem into smaller steps
Design a logical flow to solve it
Convert the algorithm into actual C code

🔹 4. Iterative Approach vs Recursive Approach
I learned how an iterative approach can be used to solve problems efficiently without using recursion, which helps in reducing memory usage.

🔹 5. Input and Output Handling
I practiced using:
scanf() for taking input from the user
printf() for displaying output clearly

🔹 6. Debugging and Error Handling
During the project, I learned how to:
Identify logical errors
Fix runtime and compilation errors
Understand error messages generated by the compiler

🔹 7. Use of Compiler and Command Line
I learned how to:
Compile a C program using GCC
Execute programs using the command line
Understand the compilation process on Windows

🔹 8. Version Control Using Git & GitHub
I learned how to:
Initialize a Git repository
Commit code changes
Upload projects to GitHub for version control and sharing

🔹 9. Writing Project Documentation
I learned how to:
Write a clear project description
Explain algorithm and logic
Present input/output examples properly

🔹 10. Importance of Clean and Readable Code
I understood the importance of:
Writing meaningful variable names
Adding comments for better readability
Structuring code for maintainability

✅ Conclusion

The Digital Root Calculator project successfully demonstrates the use of loops, arithmetic operators, and conditional logic in C programming. It is simple, efficient, and suitable for academic learning. This project strengthens foundational programming skills and provides insight into real-world numerical computations.
